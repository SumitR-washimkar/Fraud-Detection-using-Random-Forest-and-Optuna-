# Fraud-Detection-using-Random-Forest-and-Optuna-
n this section of the project, we will identify and evaluate the most important features that contribute to predicting fraudulent transactions. Using a trained **Random Forest Classifier** model, we will extract the feature importance scores, which indicate the relative contribution of each feature to the modelâ€™s predictions.
